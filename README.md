# Contribute to the website

This website is built from <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> framework that is based on [React](https://reactjs.org/).

You'll need to setup a gatsby development environment in order to preview the website. 

  1. For Windows users, Download and install the latest Node.js version from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">the official Node.js website</a>. 
  For other OS visit <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#install-nodejs-for-your-appropriate-operating-system">here</a>. (You might also need to download Visual Studio installer to install node.js development tools).
  
  2. Install <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git</a>. 
  
  3. Install Gatsby CLI by running   `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

  4. Fork this repository and open up your Git Bash (and navigate to a directory you want to place the site) and run `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dataviz-hub2.git` then run `cd dataviz-hub2` and `npm install` (install dependencies).
  
  5. Create a new local branch with commands `git checkout master` (make sure you're in master branch), `git branch newBranchName` (create a new branch from master), and `git checkout newBranchName` (switch to new branch).
    Now make any commits you wish to.
   
<b>NOTE:</b> At step 4, If you have write permission for the origin repository, then you could just create a new branch in the origin repository and clone it. 

If you have <b>Github Desktop</b> installed then just clone the repository into your computer and under the repository you would need to use Git Bash to run `npm install` etc.


```
If you cloned a while a ago, fetch the latest commits from origin repository:

git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

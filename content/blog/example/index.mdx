    Introduction <br/><br/>
  </h1>
  <p>
      The National Basketball Association (NBA) was established in New York on June 6, 1946 and it is
    a men's professional basketball league composed of 30 teams in North America and Canada (NBA,
    2019). <br/><br/>
    The association brings together the world's top players and it is regarded as the world's top
    professional basketball league. Since its establishment, the NBA has been recording data on players'
    scores, assists and eld goal percentage (NBA, 2019). With the development of technology and people's
    attention to data, more and more indicators have been added to the database and used to establish
    dierent evaluation systems. For example, (Mikoªajec, Maszczyk, and Zaj¡c, 2013) found that the data
    obtained by doctors from smart wearable devices cannot only help maintain the health of the players,
    but also help the players to better prevent injuries and better from injuries by using more detailed
    data and combining the medical equipment owned by the team, and recover faster. On the other hand,
    coaches can develop tactics based on oensive and defensive data on the eld, use video and data as an
    improvement guide for action, and chose to sign the right player (Mikoªajec et al., 2013). In addition,
    the player's data in the game is used to make technical statistics. But the most popular system is the
    scores and rankings of the players and teams participating in the competition. <br/><br/>
    Today, the NBA uses a variety of awards to recognising players' abilities, such as the MVP in the
    regular and All-Star games, the Rookie of the Year, the best defensive player, and the fastest-growing
    player (NBA, 2019). In an NBA game, each indicator of on-site technical statistics (such as points
    scored by the player, number of three-pointers, and number of individual steals) reects the player's
    ability in one aspect. We cannot distinguish the player's three-pointer ability and free throw ability
    from the player's score, nor can we simply determine the player's oensive ability from the assist
    data. A single indicator has its irreplaceable role, but its limitations determine that it cannot make
    an objective and comprehensive evaluation of the comprehensive ability of basketball players.
    Therefore, this dissertation will select appropriate summaries and use Latent variable model and
    an optimisation function algorithm to calculate the player's overall ability after each game, and then
    develop a adjustable workflow from reading and processing, modelling to the nal display of results.

With the Shiny package you can build interactive web applications using R script.
This tutorial will give you quick-start guide to help you begin to explore the versatile package and create your own applications as well as present some ready to use templates to help you to build your first Shiny app. 

With the Shiny package installed you can start to develop your app.
The basic components of a shiny app are ui commands and server commands.
The ui commands make up the user facing part of the app, this is where users can declare inputs;
common inputs are listed in this <a href = "https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html"> helpful widget gallery</a>.
The server commands are where the bulk of your processing will take place.
These two components can be created in a single app.r file as shown below:  

```R
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  <UI Commands>
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  <Server Commands>
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
However, these files can become lengthy and difficult to read, particularly for complex applications.
Therefore it is common practice to separate the ui and server components into separate files, stored together in a new directory.
Each component named `ui.R` and `server.R` respectively.  

## A Simple Shiny App

The following code is an example of a simple shiny app which creates a sine wave with time equal to the user input.

<iframe height = "500" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://gi-tuos.shinyapps.io/demo_shiny/"> </iframe>

In this example the ui file is built in a fluid page format, containing a numeric input widget and a plot output.
The numeric input widget allows users to specify the sample size. This value is referred to as `input\$\<id\>`.
The plot output is refered to as `output\$\<id\>` and is called from the server.r file.

```R
ui <- fluidPage(
  numericInput(inputId = "Num",
               "Sample size", value = 15),
  plotOutput(outputId = "LinePlot")
)
```
The server.r file contains instructions on how to build the output objects called in the ui.
Inputs from the ui file are called by name as specifed in the ui file, in this case, input$Num.
renderPlot({}) specifies the code required to create the LinePlot object, which is called into the ui.r file.


```R
server <- function(input, output) {

  output$LinePlot <- renderPlot({
    x=seq(0, input$Num, 0.1)
    y=sin(x)
    df <- data.frame(x, y)

    ggplot(data = df, aes(x, y)) +
      geom_line() +
      labs(x = "Time", y = "Sine Wave")
  })
 }
 ```

This Shiny app also uses a `global.R` file, stored in the same directory as the `server.R` and `ui.R` files.
This file defines objects that are available to both sides of the application.
`Global.R` files are executed only once as the app compiles. In this instance it contains the command to load relevant packages

```R
library("tidyverse")
```  

## Templates
If you are new to Shiny then these [official tutorials](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) will be really helpful to get you started. We also encourage you to get inspiration from the [Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) which consist of many wonderful Shiny apps created within the Shiny app developer community. All apps in the Shiny Gallery are open source and you are most welcomed to learn from others!  
  

When creating a Shiny app, we recommend you to consider the following steps (preferably in order):  
<Accordion allowZeroExpanded="true">
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItemHeading>
      <AccordionItemButton>
        LAYOUT
      </AccordionItemButton>
    </AccordionItemHeading>
    <AccordionItemPanel>
      The first thing to consider is the overall layout of the app. Depeneding on the complexity and the nature of your app (whether it is a simple app to display data as a table or Shiny-based website focus on particular group of audiences), it is always helpful to sketch the design before you start building the app. For example, if you expect many charts and contents then it is best to divide them into multiple pages. 
    </AccordionItemPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItemHeading>
      <AccordionItemButton>
        INTERACTIVE
      </AccordionItemButton>
    </AccordionItemHeading>
    <AccordionItemPanel>
      After the layout of the app and locations for each chart are planned, what sort of interactive elements you want to add on top of the chart? Suppose the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars">mtcars</a> dataset was given and a table was created for displaying the dataset in rows, a <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/sliders.html">slider widget</a> could be use to set the range for the variable <em>miles per gallon (mpg)</em> and the table will be filtered accordingly. Alternatively, the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/selectize-vs-select.html">select widget</a> will also be helpful. There are many other widgets available and you can learn more at the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html">Widgets section</a>.
    </AccordionItemPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItemHeading>
      <AccordionItemButton>
        IMPLEMENTATION
      </AccordionItemButton>
    </AccordionItemHeading>
    <AccordionItemPanel>
      Once all design work have completed we can start building the app as we have went through at the beginning of the tutorial but mostly likely with much more elements. We recommend you refer to the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/">latest reference</a> for the Shiny package, the development team of Shiny have wonderfully organised functions and corresponding description in a clean fasion so it is relatively easy to navigate through the reference. The app will likely to slow down as the size of dataset increases, you might want consider using <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson6/">reactive expression</a> in your app to improve performances.
    </AccordionItemPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItemHeading>
      <AccordionItemButton>
        STYLES
      </AccordionItemButton>
    </AccordionItemHeading>
    <AccordionItemPanel>
      It is worth a while to consider the appearance of your app, e.g. the font size, text colours, background colours, and spaces between elements. Shiny has HTML5 equivalent functions that can be used to wrap elements and add inline styles, you can learn more from the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson2/">UI interface tutorial</a>. In addition, you might also find <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/">Shiny Themes</a> helpful for alter the overall appearance.

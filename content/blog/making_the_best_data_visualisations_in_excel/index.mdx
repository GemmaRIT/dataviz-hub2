## About Excel
**Microsoft Excel** is a well-known spreadsheet developed by Microsoft for platforms like Windows, macOS, and 
various mobile operating systems. Excel has been the industry standards for spreadsheet since 1993 and commonly used for 
calculations, creating graphs and charts, and pivoting tables. Microsoft built **Visual Basic for 
Application** (also known as VBA, derived from the programming language Visual Basic) into Excel that allows you to write scripts 
that automates repeated tasks, this script often called a **macro** - a series of instructions. Excel is easy to use with 
graphics interface and useful documentations/hints, and the graphical representation of data and built-in mathematical formulas 
makes calculations straight-forward and simple. Additionly, Excel has substantial number of graphs and charts under the hood 
so that you can create some visualisations in minutes, providing you have the right data structure for chosen charts.  

*Note: All graphs/charts below are created using **Excel 2016**.*

## Best Practices
No matter what kind of tools you want to use, there are some questions you need to ask yourself before creating visualisations.

      <AccordionItemButton>
        1. Who are your audiences?
      </AccordionItemButton>
    </AccordionItemHeading>
    <AccordionItemPanel>
      Stakeholders comes from various areas with <b>different backgrounds</b> and it is likely they would not have the same mindset as you do, 
      you need to know who is your target audience in order to select and deliver key and relevant information. For stakeholders with 
      management roles, you might want to present data in a dashboard so they can have an overview of matters. Whereas for team 
      meetings you could use some charts to discuss specific problems. Complicated and fancy charts aren't always the best, be aware that 
      your audiences might need to spend extra time to learn what is going on.

      <AccordionItemButton>
        2. What problems are they facing?
      </AccordionItemButton>
    </AccordionItemHeading>
    <AccordionItemPanel>
      <b>Who</b> are you stakeholders? Researchers, students, professional staffs, or parents? An effective data visualisation should be able to answer 
      questions from stakeholders (could be yourself). Wihtout a good understanding of stakeholders' situation you might end up with 
      purposeless (and time-consuming) visualisations, so be sure you know <b>what you are aiming for</b>. 
    </AccordionItemPanel>
  </AccordionItem>

    <AccordionItemHeading>
      <AccordionItemButton>
        3. What type of data you have?
      </AccordionItemButton>
    </AccordionItemHeading>
    <AccordionItemPanel>
      Do you know what type of data you are working with? If it is <b>qualitative</b> data, can you classify it further to binomial, nominal, or ordinal? 
      For <b>quantitative</b> data, would you be able to identify whether it is continuous or discrete? Understand the type of data you have is key to 
      select the right visualisation.
    </AccordionItemPanel>
  </AccordionItem>

      <AccordionItemButton>
        4. What information you want to send across?
      </AccordionItemButton>
    </AccordionItemHeading>
    <AccordionItemPanel>
      There are <b>more than 40</b> different types of charts/graphs nowadays and each of them are designed for specific types of data and purpose. 
      Knowing what information you want to deliver not only helps you in deciding what charts/graphs to use, but also assesses how well your visualisation 
      performs against stakeholders' problems.

Once we have answered each of the questions above, what specific actions could we take when making data visualisation in Excel?  

### Preparation of spreadsheets
To cook a dish you will allocate a substantial amount of time in the preparation of ingredients, whether you need to clean, rinse, slice, 
curing, freeze, decoatâ€¦ Typically, the more time you spend in taking care of ingredients, the more flavour you get out of it. In making a visualisation 
you will also need to spend some time in preparation of the data. The table below listed some of common things you might want to take into account:  

<div>
<table className="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Data types</th>
      <td>There are over ten different data types available (Microsoft are expanding this to more than 100!) and Excel will interpret each type differently. 
        Having a suitable data type for each column help to maintain the consistence of column values and help you to avoid unsuitable graphs.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Order of sheets</th>
      <td>It is common that you might have more than one spreadsheet in an Excel file, therefore, by ordering spreadsheets in a way that matches the order in your 
        process could help you locate information more easily and will also be beneficial to your collarators.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Missing values</th>
      <td>Missing values could have a significant effect on your outputs, it typically occurs when a cell doesn't have a value (when it is required) or 
        the value is represented by <b>NA</b>, <b>NaN</b>, <b>Null</b> etc. Generally, you can <b>impute</b> missing values by column average, median, most 
        frequent value, and k-nearest neighbourhood (k-NN). However, missing value itself is a broad topic and there are different resolutions 
        depending on the value's data type, the relationship between data rows, and potentially other hidden issues.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Clarity</th>
      <td>Check that your spreadsheet is easy to read and understand, for example, don't use complicated or irrelevant column names.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Merge cells</th>
      <td><b>Avoid</b> merge cells if you can as this could discard some value and cause inconsistencies.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Sorting</th>
      <td>Excel does not perform sorting for you when creating graphs/charts, so watch out for your column values if you need to present values in certain order.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Macros</th>
      <td>Considering using macro if you need to perform some repeated tasks.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Conditional formatting</th>
      <td>Use of conditional formatting could help you to identify <b>trends and patterns</b> within your spreadsheets by changing the visual appearance of cells.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Data validation</th>
      <td>Data validation is a feature in Excel that validates users input for a cell. Use of data validation could help you avoid inconsistent data values.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Protection</th>
      <td>If you're collarate with other people and do not wish them to change certain cells, you can 
        add <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/protect-a-worksheet-3179efdb-1285-4d49-a9c3-f4ca36276de6">protection</a> to the spreadsheet by lock cells up.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

### Select appropriate charts/graphs
You might have already noticed that Excel has a convenient built-in feature called <b>Recommended Charts</b> in the <b>Insert</b> section, as the name suggests 
it analyse and recommends charts to you based on the cells you have selected. If you want to make your own decision or wish to learn how to choose correct charts,

### Making visualisations
After you have made your mind of which chart to use, it doesn't necessarily mean that you are done and can walk away with this visualisation. There 
are some details you have to watch out:

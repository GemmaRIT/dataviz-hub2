# What is D3.js
**D3** stands for **Data-Driven Document** and **[D3.js](https://d3js.org/)** is known as an open-source Javascript 
library that is capable of producing *web-based interactive data visualisations* 
in web browsers using **SVG**, **HTML** and **CSS**. It is powerful and customisable yet has 
a *steep learning curve*. If you are interested in online data visualisation or 
you have used many data visulisation libraries and want to DIY your own 
chart then give it a go!  
  
**[Mike Bostock](https://twitter.com/mbostock)** - the main author of **D3.js** also created an online platform called 
**[ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/)** where you can host your javascript notebooks (similar to how 
Jupyter Notebook works for Python) to explore and visualise your data. This 
platform is especially useful when you first start learning D3.js, as no 
installation is required to import D3 modules plus you can fork other people's 
notebook and build on top of it!  

<br/> 

# What you need to know 
Unlike programming languages such as **Python** and **R** that have some high-level 
libraries that allow you to draw interactive and informative graphics, 
D3.js gives you the freedom to build whatever you can imagine from 
low-levels. Although there are plenty of resources available online for you to 
learn D3.js, it is **recommended** you have some practical knowledge of following 
things before you proceed:  
  - **Javascript**
  - **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics)
  - **HTML5** (HyperText Markup Language)
  - **CSS** (Cascade Style Sheet)
    
**D3.js** is built from Javascript and no doubt you will need to know Javascript 
so that you will have no trouble dealing with data and functions. **SVG** is an 
XML-based vector graphics format and should always be the first and largest 
element of any D3 graphic you want to create. SVG acts as a container which 
allows you to draw any shapes within it using a set of basic shape elements 
such as rectangles, circles, ellipses, paths, straight lines, polylines, and 
polygons. D3 makes use of this mechanism which adds graphics and text to SVG 
and then binds data to those elements. An example of SVG:

```html
<svg width="500" height="300">
   <rect x="0" y="0" width="300" height="200" fill="yellow"></rect>
</svg>
```

<svg width="500" height="300">
   <rect x="0" y="0" width="300" height="200" fill="yellow"></rect>
</svg>  
  
If you have ever experience in creating web pages or similar then you should be 
familiar with HTML and CSS. HTML is the standard markup language for creating 
web pages as well as defining the structure of web pages, whereas HTML5 is the 
latest standard of HTML. CSS is the style language used for styling HTML documents 
and hence different websites have their presentation styles depending on how they 
define it.

# Installation
To use D3.js you can either download the latest version 
from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org/) then include it in the head tag or place the 
following script within the head tag of your html file:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
```  
  
<br/>

# Core Concepts
Rather than include everything (which are not possible) here, this article aims 
to give an introduction to the foundation of **D3** and let you discover other methods 
in the **[D3 API document](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md)** when needed. Note that this article is written based on D3 
version 5.16 and there might be some changes to D3 in the future which invalid 
some of the codes here.  

## Selections
One important aspect of D3 is the *DOM manipulation*. The 
**DOM** (Document Object Model) is an independent interface which organises an 
XML/HTML document into tree structure and each node within the tree represents 
a part of the document. Selection methods in D3 look similar to CSS 
selectors (actually it is based on CSS selectors) and allow you select elements 
within the DOM of the current web page then perform any other actions on it. There 
are two selection methods:  
  - **select()** - select the DOM element matched the given criteria within the 
  bracket. If there are more than one elements matched, only select the first 
  element. For example, *select("div")* will return the first div element in the 
  DOM tree, `select(".myclass")` return the first element that has the 
  class `myclass`.
  - **selectAll()** - similar to *select()* method but returns all elements that match 
  the criteria.  
  
But what could you do with **selected elements**? 

### New elements
  - **Append()** - allows you to modify the element or add new elements within 
  the selected element. For example, `d3.select("div").append("g")` add a `<g>` tag 
  element to the first div element (beware it doesnt change or replace existing 
  elements).
  
  ```html
  <div>
    <g></g>
  </div>
  ```

  - **text()** - set the content of the selected element

### Manipulation

# A simple example


<svg id="d3" className="lg:-ml-60 md:min-w-80 md:min-h-60 lg:min-h-60"></svg>
<div className="tooltip"></div>

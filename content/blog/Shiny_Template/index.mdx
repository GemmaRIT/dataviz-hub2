With the Shiny package you can build interactive web applications using R script.
This tutorial will give you quick-start guide to help you begin to explore the
versatile package and create your own applications.

With the Shiny package installed you can start to develop your app.
The basic components of a shiny app are ui commands and server commands.
The ui commands make up the user facing part of the app, this is where users can declare inputs;
common inputs are listed in this <a href = "https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html"> helpful widget gallery</a>.
The server commands are where the bulk of your processing will take place.
These two components can be created in a single app.r file as shown below:


```R
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  <UI Commands>
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  <Server Commands>
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
However, these files can become lengthy and difficult to read, particularly for complex applications.
Therefore it is common practice to separate the ui and server components into separate files, stored together in a new directory.
Each component named ui.r and server.r respectively.

### A Simple Shiny App

The following code is an example of a simple shiny app which creates a sine wave with time equal to the user input.

<iframe height = "500" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://gi-tuos.shinyapps.io/demo_shiny/"> </iframe>

In this example the ui file is built in a fluid page format, containing a numeric input widget and a plot output.
The numeric input widget allows users to specify the sample size. This value is referred to as input\$\<id\>.
The plot output is refered to as output\$\<id\> and is called from the server.r file.

```R
ui <- fluidPage(
  numericInput(inputId = "Num",
               "Sample size", value = 15),
  plotOutput(outputId = "LinePlot")
)
```
The server.r file contains instructions on how to build the output objects called in the ui.
Inputs from the ui file are called by name as specifed in the ui file, in this case, input$Num.
renderPlot({}) specifies the code required to create the LinePlot object, which is called into the ui.r file.


```R
server <- function(input, output) {

  output$LinePlot <- renderPlot({
    x=seq(0, input$Num, 0.1)
    y=sin(x)
    df <- data.frame(x, y)

    ggplot(data = df, aes(x, y)) +
      geom_line() +
      labs(x = "Time", y = "Sine Wave")
  })
 }
 ```

This Shiny app also uses a global.r file, stored in the same directory as the server.r and ui.r files.
This file defines objects that are available to both sides of the application.
Global.r files are executed only once as the app compiles. In this instance it contains the command to load relevant packages

```R
library("tidyverse")
```

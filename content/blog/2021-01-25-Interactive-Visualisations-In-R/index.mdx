# Introduction
Welcome to the **third blog post** of the series *Exploring packages in R*. In this blog post we will explore some of the most popular packages in R for **Interactive Visualisations** and some of which you might have already noticed. Same as in the <Link to="/blog/20/01/2021/Static-Visualisations-In-R">previous blog post</Link>, I will be using the [Hadfield Green Roof 5-year dataset](https://doi.org/10.15131/shef.data.11876736.v1) and assume you already have some experience with R.

You can find all the source code in [this Github repository](https://github.com/yld-weng/hadfield-green-roof). If you have any suggestions or want me to include any particular package feel free to [send me an email](mailto:y.weng@sheffield.ac.uk)!  


In the first two sections we will explore *Plotly* and *Shiny* which are among the most downloaded visualisation packages, and then followed by other interactive packages in later sections.

You might wonder what *htmlwidgets* is - *"A framework for creating HTML widgets that render in various contexts including the R console, 'R Markdown' documents, and 'Shiny' web applications."* In fact, any interactive visualisations produced that can be saved as a standalone HTML file uses *htmlwidgets*, including packages like *plotly*, *leaflet*, and *ggiraph* that we are going to learn about.  


# Plotly
Plotly was known for providing scientifc charing libraries that has been increasingly popular over the last few years and you can discover its place in many popular programming languages and platforms such as Python, R, Javascript, Angular, React.JS, and .NET.  
 
The *plotly* package in R was created as an interface to the Javascript Library plotly.js therefore you can create many interactive web-based graphics out of it. Since the package also depends on the *ggplot2* package we have explored in the previous blog post, we can actually interact with the charts and graphs we have made by using the *ggplotly()* function that converts a ggplot2 object into a plotly object!  
 
To see examples of open-source graphics made with the R *plotly* package, use this [link](https://plotly.com/r/). These examples are appended with read-to-run code blocks that will help you get started very qucikly. In addition, if you are looking for a particular graph, most of the sections containing a 'More...' link that leads to a range of extra visualisations. For extensive documentation of the package take a look at the [PDF from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly/plotly.pdf).  


 
## ggplot2 to plotly  
If you have made some wonderful charts using *ggplot2* then rather than starting from scratch in *plotly* we can instantly convert it to a plotly object and work with it directly.  
 
Using the bar chart in the previous blog post as an example, we can first assign the graph to an variable before using the `ggplotly()` function for conversion:
 
```r
plot1 <- shefClimateNoNA %>% ... # skip rest of codes
 
ggplotly(plot1, tooltip = c("x", "AirTC_Avg"))
```

If you want to play with the interactive version of this bar chart, right click [this link](https://github.com/yld-weng/hadfield-green-roof/blob/main/part3/barChart.html) to save the standalone HTML file to your device and open it with your favourite browser.  


## Example (heatmap)
Now let's use the heatmap as an example to visualise the daily average temperature for the period from 1 Jan 2015 to 31 Dec 2015. First we need to tidy and transform data in few steps:  
1. Filter dates we do not want 
2. Add two columns *month* and *day* from *TIMESTAMP* and drop all other columns except air temperature
3. Group data by day and compute the average temperature over 24 hours
4. Transform the data frame so that we have monthly calendar with temperatures on seperate rows
5. Drop the *month* column and onvert the data frame into matrix

```r
shefClimateHeatmap <- shefClimateNoNA %>%
  filter(
    between(TIMESTAMP, as.POSIXct("2015-01-01"), as.POSIXct("2016-01-01"))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month(TIMESTAMP, label = TRUE),
    day = day(TIMESTAMP)
  ) %>%
  select(AirTC_Avg, month, day) %>% 
  group_by(month, day) %>% 
  summarise(AirTC_Avg = mean(AirTC_Avg)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = day, values_from = AirTC_Avg) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-c(month)) %>% 
  as.matrix()
```

Now we can create our heatmap with transformed data:

```r
myHeatmap <- plot_ly(
  x = sprintf("%d", 1:31),
  y = month.abb[1:12],
  z = shefClimateHeatmap, 
  type = "heatmap"
) 
```

Add some customisation for the title and hover texts:

```r
myHeatmap %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Daily average temperature in Sheffield (2015)"
  ) %>%
  add_trace(
    showscale = FALSE,
    hovertemplate = paste(
      '<b>Date</b>: %{x} %{y}', 
      '<br><b>Temperature</b>: %{z:.2f} C',
      '<extra></extra>' # add EXTRA tag to hide trace name
    )
  )
```

## Dash
Dash is a framework that was firstly built in Python for building interactive web applications, and Dash for R was first announced in July 2019. Dash is designed to suit any programming languages with 80% of it being Javascript and API design. If you have used Dash in Python then it is just a matter of changing the interface to call the API, this strong foundation makes *Dash* a good alternative to *Shiny* that will be introduced in the next section.  

You can also visit our website's <Link to="/blog/tag/dash">Dash tag</Link> for more articles and tutorials.


# Shiny
Shiny is a versatile package designed to make it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R and you can embed it anywhere in R Markdown documents or extend it with other packages to create your own widgets. If you already have some knowledge in R, then you can design your own app in a few hours by visiting [offcial video and written tutorials](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/).  


## vs Dash
**Learning curve:** Whilst both tools are created based on ReactJS (a Javascript Framework), Shiny is great for R beginners or non-technical users, whereas you might be unhappy with Dash if you have zero experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

**Hosting:** Both tools offer a free hosting solution and you'll get a unique url for each individual app. If you prefer Dash then it is recommended you [host apps on Heroku](https://dashr.plotly.com/deployment). For Shiny you can [deploy](https://shiny.rstudio.com/deploy/) up to 5 apps for free on Shinyapps.io via RStudio directly.

**Community:** Both tools created an active community, and Dash's design philosophy makes it easy to transfer knowledge between Python and R.

**Ecosystem:** At the moment I believe Shiny is much more mature and Dash is relatively new in R. Beside web applications, Shiny can also be embedded in R Markdown documents, use to build dashboards, and be extended with htmlwidgets, CSS themes, and shinyjs.




# Other packages
In this section I'll briefly introduce some packages you can use as an alternative or in addition to *ggplot2*. Over the time there will be more great packages coming out so if you have any suggestions or want to include any particular package in this section feel free to [send me an email](mailto:y.weng@sheffield.ac.uk).

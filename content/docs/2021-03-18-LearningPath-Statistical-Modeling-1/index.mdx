## Introduction
A **[random variable](https://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/ranvar.htm)** is a numerical representation (can be either a set of values or a function mapped to a continous range) of an experiment's outcomes. A **[probability distribution](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda361.htm)** is a mathematical function that gives the probabilities for different possible outcomes of the experiment. Consider an experiment of drawing a ball three times with replacement from a urn which consist of seven reds balls and three blue balls. If a random variable **X** represents the total number of times we drawn a blue ball, then the set of values that **X** can be are:  {$0, 1, 2, 3$}. Then the probability distribution for the random variable **X** gives the probabilities for these outcomes to happen. For example, the chance of getting blue balls from the urn in all three drawn will be $(\frac{3}{10})^{3} = \frac{27}{1000} = 2.7\%$. If the random variable is discrete then it has a corresponding discrete probability distribution, this is also true for continuous random variable.  

In practice, datasets can be described as samples of the population or outcomes of random variables (features that we have collected). Each dataset usually have two or more variables and each variable could have different probability distributions. It is often our interests to identify dataset's distribution   In this section we will be exploring probability distributions for common variable types such as binary, ordinal, nominal, and continuous.

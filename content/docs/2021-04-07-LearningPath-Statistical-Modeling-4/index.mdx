## Introduction
Statistical (hypothesis) testing is a methodology in **frequentist inference** (often compared with bayesian inference) that used to determine whether the difference between sample and sample, sample and population is caused by sampling error or underlying difference. The significance test is one of the most commonly used methods of hypothesis testing and the most basic form of statistical inference, the basic principle of which is to make some assumptions about the characteristics of the population first, then make inference through studies of sampling and decide whether the hypothesis (assumptions made) should be rejected or accepted. Commonly used hypothesis test methods are Z-test, t-test, F-test and so on.  

Statistical tests has the following applications:  
- test a hypothesis we have made 
- compare two statistical models (estimate differences)
- determine relationship between variables


### Sidenote
The major difference between the **frequentist inference** and **bayesian inference** (both are type of statistics inference) lies in how they interpret the parameter space (i.e. all possible values of parameters we're trying to estimate). The frequentist approach considering that there is are unique true constant parameters, the observation data is generated under these parameters. Since it is not known which values the parameters are, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and confidence interval are introduced to estimate parameters in the parameter space. Whilst the bayesian approach considered that the parameter itself has a probability distribution, thus parameters might not be unique. Each value in the parameter space has some probability to be the parameter used by the real model so prior distribution (prior distribution) and posterior distribution (posterior distribution) are introduced to find out the probability of each parameter value in the parameter space.

## Z-Test 

## F-Test






Frequentist inference is the process of determining properties of an underlying distribution via the observation of data.

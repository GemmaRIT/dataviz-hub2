## Introduction
Sampling refers to the process of extracting individuals or samples from the population, that is, the process of experimenting or observing the target population. In practice, it is infeasible to get hold of the entire population due to many reasons such as time and cost. There are two types of sampling: random sampling and non-random sampling (you can also refer them as probability sampling and non-probability sampling). The former refers to a sampling method that draws samples from the population in accordance with the principle of randomisation where it does not carry any subjectivity. Methods of random sampling includes simple random sampling, systematic sampling, cluster sampling and stratified sampling. The latter is a method of extracting samples based on the researcher's opinions, experience, or relevant knowledge, therefore is subjective. These methods are convenience sampling, Voluntary sampling, snowball sampling, and judgemental sampling.  
 
There are some key points to consider before building a model because we would like the characteristic of samples to be as close to the population as possible. We should always try our best to avoid sampling bias, reduce sampling error, and yield a true representative sample of the population. 

In this material we will be looking at sampling methods and ways to describe a sample.

## Random Sampling
Random sampling (or probability sampling) refers to nonsubjective sampling methods that apply some mechanism to ensure randomness. 
 
### Simple random
The simple random sampling ensures individuals in the population have equal probability of getting chosen. To ensure randomness, people usually assign individuals a unique number beforehand and use computers to generate random numbers, then choose individuals according to the generated number.  
 
**Disadvantages**: every individual is chosen at random but there is no way to ensure we have a representative sample for all subgroups.
 
 
### Systematic
The systematic sampling method starts with a random starting point and selects individuals from the population with a periodic interval. For example, we start from the 2nd individual and choose every 10th individual (12th, 22nd, 32nd, ...) that are encountered until the end of the population or up to the target sample size. The interval is usually calculated as the number of populations divided by the sample size. The main advantage of the systematic sampling method over the simple random sampling method is the cost.
 
**Disadvantages**: Some populations may contain hidden patterns and we may be negligent and select them as samples.
 
### Stratified

![Stratified sampling](./stratified.png)  

The stratified sampling method aims to create a sample which is representable for every subgroup. The main idea is to divide the population into homogeneous subgroups and choose an equal number of samples from each subgroup using the simple random sampling methods. The stratified sampling method is suitable for survey subjects with a large population and large internal differences. Compared with simple random sampling and systematic sampling, when the sample size is the same, its sampling error is smaller; when the sampling error requirements are the same, it requires a smaller sample size.  

**Disadvantages**: you must have a good understanding of the overall situation of the population, otherwise it is impossible to make a good classification of subgroups. This is often difficult to achieve before actual investigations of the population.
 
### Cluster

![Cluster sampling](./cluster.png)  
*Clusters 1, 4, 5 are chosen*  

Cluster sampling refers to a sampling method that selects all samples from a certain number of clusters. For example, when inspecting the quality of a certain electrical part, instead of inspecting the electrical parts one by one, a number of boxes (each box contains several electrical parts) are randomly selected to conduct a comprehensive inspection of each box. Note that clusters share some characteristics. The selection of the clusters can be done by either simple random sampling or systematic sampling.
 
The application of the cluster sampling method is different from the stratified sampling method.
The stratified sampling method is suitable when a certain population contains several subgroups (or categories, levels) and subgroups have substantial differences from each other but exhibit small differences within the group. Conversely, go for cluster sampling when the difference between subgroups is not significant, and there is large variation within subgroups.
 
**Disadvantages**: due to the large differences between different groups, the sampling error caused by this is often greater than simple random sampling. Additionally, the sample is not widely distributed, and the representativeness of the sample to the population is relatively poor.  

## Non-random Sampling
Non-random sampling (or non-probability sampling) refers to subjective sampling methods in which researchers draw samples according to his/her own convenience or subjective judgment. It does not strictly follow the principle of random sampling to draw samples so it cannot determine the sampling error, and cannot correctly explain to what extent the statistical value of the sample is suitable for the population.  
 
### Convenience
The convenience sampling method refers to the way that researchers choose samples arbitrarily according to the convenience of researchers. For example, several pedestrians are selected for an interview at the intersection of the street. This method is the simplest, most cost-effective and time-saving method in non-probability sampling. However, if differences between individuals in the population found to be large, we also get large sampling errors.  
 
**Disadvantages**: samples usually have large deviations and low credibility, and are not sufficiently representative.
 
### Voluntary
  
![Voluntary Survey](./survey.png)   

Voluntary (or voluntary response) sampling, as the name suggests is a sampling method in which individuals volunteer themselves to be the sample. For example, online surveys.
 
**Disadvantages**: Some people are more willing to participate in the experiment/survey which leads to sampling bias.
 
### Snowball
Snowball sampling refers to randomly selecting some interviewees and conducting interviews with them, then asking them to recommend some other possible individuals that are part of the research target population. Thereafter, we select the individuals based on the recommendation and so on. Snowball sampling is often used for surveys of rare populations or distributed uneven populations.  
 
**Disadvantages**: Sample could be limited to a group of people with similar thought and mindset, which will cause serious under-representation problems. This group of people is often just a smaller group in the subgroup that the researcher wants to study.  
 
 
### Judgemental
Judgemental (or purposive) sampling refers to when the researcher is familiar with his/her research field and has a good understanding of the survey overall, a highly representative sample may be obtained by selecting objects/individuals entirely based on experiences. This sampling method is mostly used when the population is small and the internal differences are large, and when the overall boundary cannot be determined or because resources are limited. For example, a company wishes to investigate the tourism market in England, relevant departments select tourist spots such as London, Oxford, Cambridge, and York.  
 
**Disadvantages**: Sample is greatly affected by the tendency of the researcher. If the subjective judgment is biased, it is easy to cause sampling bias. In addition, samples are not suitable to infer the overall population.  


## Online sampling tool
[The essycode website](https://www.essycode.com/distribution-viewer/) have created a really useful tool that allows users to see probability mass/density functions and cumulative distribution functions for a range of probability distributions. You can also enter different parameters and functions will be altered accordingly.  
 
We also recommend you to use the **Sample** button at the top right corner of that website and try to generate samples in 10, 100, 1000, 10,000, and 100,000 to see the difference in the generated graphs. You will find that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution generated at the bottom will approximate the theoretical distribution at the top. Samples are always discrete distributions but can approximate continuous distributions if the sample size is large enough.  




## Describe a sample
Once we have samples from a distribution or a population, we should consider using some measures such as dispersion and central tendency to describe the characteristic of the samples. Samples from different distributions would likely be treated differently.
 
### Binary variable
For samples from a binary variable, we can use the percentage (%) to get the ratio of two categories. For example, suppose the Dataviz.Shef has 1,290 visitors this month and we have a variable that tells us whether the visitor uses a mobile device to visit our website. We take five samples with a sample size of ten each and on average 3 people use mobile devices to visit the website. Then we can use 30% to describe this statistic instead of plain numbers.
 
### Multinomial
For samples with multiple categories, consider using mode in addition to percentages. The mode will tell us what value/category has the highest proportion in the distribution. Note that the distribution can have more than one mode.
 
### Ordinal
Similar to multinomial and binary variables, we should consider use percentages for ordinal data. However, median will be used instead of mode since categories are ordered in ordinal data and we are interested in the central tendency.
 

### Discrete
The choices for discrete data will be wider and more common. Some measures we can use are minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation. In addition, one might also consider interquartile range (IQR) and variance.

### Continuous
In addition to measures mentioned for discrete data, kurtosis and skewness are often used to describe the shape of the distribution. Kurtosis describes the tail of the distribution whereas skewness measures the asymmetry.

description: A statistical model is a non-deterministic mathematical model used to describe the relationship between different variables. It contains a set of assumptions about the sample data and usually represent the data generation process in a fairly idealised form. On the other hand, statistical modeling is the process of exploring of statistical models which could represent and best describe observed data.

    <span className="text-5xl">A</span> statistical model is a non-deterministic mathematical model used to describe the relationship between different variables. It contains a set of assumptions about the sample data and usually represent the data generation process in a fairly idealised form. On the other hand, statistical modeling is the process of exploring of statistical models which could represent and best describe observed data. This process includes (but not limited to) initial selection of probability distributions, encapsulate assumptions as parameters, estimation of stochastic variables, sampling, and comparison between different models. Once a statistical model is selected, the predictive model will be used to test hypotheses, create predicted values (make prediction), and compute confidence interval.

      In this learning path we will be introducing you to probability distributions for common variable types, sampling and how to describe a sample from a certain distribution, basic of statistical model, common statistical testing techniques, and many more.

The difference between statistical models and other mathematical models is that statistical models are non-deterministic. Therefore, in the statistical model some variables do not have specific values either because they are random or due to there are deterministic elements that are unknown to us. In both cases, we model variables using probability distributions.

A simple regression looks something like the following:  

$$
Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{1}X_{i} + \epsilon_{i}
$$
